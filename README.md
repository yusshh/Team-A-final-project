ParaGlow – Reimagine Your Words

An **AI-powered text transformation system** built with Streamlit, Groq, and Hugging Face. ParaGlow provides high-speed, intelligent summarization and advanced text rephrasing capabilities through a modern, responsive user interface.

The project utilizes a professional, **refactored, and scalable architecture**, ensuring clear separation of configuration, application logic, and styling for easy maintenance and deployment.

***

## 🚀 Features

* **Intelligent Summarization:** Provides two distinct modes: Abstractive (Hugging Face BART) and Extractive.
* **High-Speed Paraphrasing:** Leverages Groq's LPU-based architecture for near-instant text rephrasing.
* **Live Text Analytics:** A **new feature** that displays real-time word count, character count, and estimated reading time beneath the input box.
* **Dynamic UI:** Custom, modern interface built with external CSS for easy themeing.
* **Configuration-Driven:** Uses `config.yaml` for file paths and `.env` for managing secret API keys.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project's structure emphasizes modularity and separation of concerns:

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | Rapidly built web interface and reactive UI |
| **Backend** | Python 3.10+ | Core application logic and API integration |
| **AI/LLM** | Hugging Face BART | Provides Abstractive Summarization capability |
| **Inference** | Groq (LPU) | Provides high-speed, low-latency Paraphrasing |
| **Configuration** | `PyYAML`, `python-dotenv` | Manages structured settings and sensitive environment variables |

## 🔧 Installation

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd Infosys_Data_Preprocessing-main
    ```

2.  **Create and activate virtual environment**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables**
    Create a **`.env`** file in the root directory:
    ```ini
    HF_API_KEY="YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    GROQ_API_KEY="YOUR_GROQ_KEY_GOES_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Start the application**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## 🧪 Testing

The refactored architecture allows for testing individual components to ensure reliability.

*Open a terminal with your `(venv)` active and your `.env` file present.*

```bash
# Test the overall model integration and flow
python src/mvp/processor.py

# Test a specific component (e.g., Groq Paraphraser)
python src/mvp/groq_rewriter.py
````
